## About

- Investigated current small-molecule kinase-inhibitor drugs used for treatments of many types of cancer, with the goal of supporting the development of new drugs of this class.

- Created a custom MySQL database of the properties and structures of currently available kinase-inhibitor drugs and their kinase targets for future design and analysis. 

- Built a web-scraping and data-processing tool in Python that gathers chemical data from APIs or directly from many distributed websites to update the database's available data in minutes, as opposed to potential hours of data-querying typically required.

- Python TKinter GUI allows for viewing properties, downloading structures, and viewing structures by interfacing with the Scripps Python Molecular Viewer.

- Conducted this investigation under the guidance of Dr. Chenglong Li in the Medicinal Chemistry department of the UF College of Pharmacy.
